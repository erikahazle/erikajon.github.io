# game-project

This is my first project for Web Immersive Course at General Assembly. 

We were tasked to utilise our our knowledge of JavaScript, HTML and CSS to design a version of Tic Tac Toe. 



Features:


Strawberries represent Crosses and Watermelons represent Noughts.

User 1 is able to select their token.

Strawberries (Crosses) go first.



Some of the other features I would like to add in the future:


Change alert to an overlay when there's a winner

Keep track of wins (have a score board)

Add sounds for when boxes are clicked

Allow users to play remotely
